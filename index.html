        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome! This tool helps you see patterns in complex situations—whether you're facing a tough decision, navigating a relationship, or just trying to make sense of something that feels messy.</p>
        <p>We'll explore your situation through five helpful lenses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Does this align with who you are and where you're going?</li>
          <li><strong>Differentiation:</strong> Are roles and boundaries clear?</li>
          <li><strong>Contextual Fit:</strong> Does this make sense for your actual situation?</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Can you trace cause and effect?</li>
          <li><strong>Reflexivity:</strong> Is there room to adjust and learn?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tool is a mirror, not a guide—it shows you structure so you can understand what's really happening.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="guidePanel" class="panel">
        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>The more specific you are, the more useful your results will be. Try to include these three elements:</p>
        
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>1. What is happening?</h3>
          <p>Describe the situation, event, conflict, or choice you're facing. Keep it concrete and specific.</p>
          <p class="example"><em>Example: "I've been offered a promotion that requires relocating, but I just signed a lease and my partner's job is here."</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>2. Who is involved?</h3>
          <p>Identify the people, groups, or relationships that matter here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yourself and your role</li>
            <li>Other people or groups involved</li>
            <li>Relevant responsibilities or commitments</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="example"><em>Example: "Me (software engineer), my partner (teacher with tenure), my new manager who made the offer, and my current team I'd be leaving."</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>3. Why this matters to you?</h3>
          <p>What are the stakes? What are you trying to achieve, protect, avoid, or maintain?</p>
          <p class="example"><em>Example: "I want career growth but also stability with my partner. I'm worried about damaging my relationship or missing this opportunity."</em></p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't worry about having it all figured out—that's what this tool is for. Just give us the pieces you can see, and we'll help you spot the patterns.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="interpretPanel" class="panel">
        <h2>Interpretation</h2>
        <p>Here's what your scores mean and what to look for in each dimension.</p>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Continuity</h3>
          <p><strong>High (0.7–1.0):</strong> This situation supports your long-term direction. Things are holding together well over time.</p>
          <p><strong>Medium (0.4–0.6):</strong> There's some stability, but also some tension. Parts of this align with your goals, while others might pull you off track.</p>
          <p><strong>Low (0.0–0.3):</strong> This situation conflicts with your longer-term commitments. You might be feeling fragmented or pulled in different directions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Differentiation</h3>
          <p><strong>High:</strong> Roles and responsibilities are well-defined. Everyone knows what's theirs to handle.</p>
          <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Some boundaries are clear, others are fuzzy. There may be areas where it's unclear who's responsible for what.</p>
          <p><strong>Low:</strong> Roles are tangled or unclear. Responsibilities might be overlapping in confusing ways, or boundaries are getting crossed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Contextual Fit</h3>
          <p><strong>High:</strong> Your approach matches the reality of the situation. What you're doing makes sense given the actual circumstances.</p>
          <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Partial match—some aspects fit, but timing or certain constraints might be off. Reality and expectations don't fully align.</p>
          <p><strong>Low:</strong> There's a mismatch between what you're trying to do and what the situation actually allows or needs right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Accountability</h3>
          <p><strong>High:</strong> Causes and effects are clear. You can see who's responsible for what and trace how decisions lead to outcomes.</p>
          <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Some things are transparent, but other parts are murky. You might be missing some information or clarity about consequences.</p>
          <p><strong>Low:</strong> Important information is hidden or unclear. It's hard to tell who's responsible or what the real consequences will be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Reflexivity</h3>
          <p><strong>High:</strong> There's room to learn and adjust as you go. You can change course without major risk if needed.</p>
          <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Some flexibility exists, but there are constraints. Adjusting might be possible but not easy.</p>
          <p><strong>Low:</strong> The situation feels rigid or locked in. Making changes seems risky or difficult, and there's little room for learning as you go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interpret-block">
          <h3>Reading Your Results</h3>
          <p><strong>Mostly high scores:</strong> The situation has good structural support. You have room to move forward with clarity.</p>
          <p><strong>Mixed scores:</strong> Pay attention to the lower-scoring areas—they show where things might get stuck or create tension. Consider what would help clarify those dimensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Mostly low scores:</strong> The situation has structural challenges. Take time to understand what's off before pushing forward. Small adjustments might help things hold together better.</p>
