⭐ Interpretation Guide: What Each Score Means

This guide explains how to read each dimension, what “high” vs “low” means, and what that implies for the situation.

You can adapt the tone or phrasing to match your UI.

Continuity Interpretation
High (0.7–1.0)

Indicates your situation is stable, aligned, and consistent with your longer-term needs.
Your choices reinforce your existing path.

Medium (0.4–0.6)

Indicates mixed continuity.
Some actions align with your long-term integrity, while others introduce instability or conflict.

Low (0.0–0.3)

Indicates significant tension between your decisions and your long-term well-being, identity, or commitments.

In practice:
Low continuity → instability or fragmentation
High continuity → long-term alignment

Differentiation Interpretation
High

Roles, boundaries, and responsibilities are clear.
Your needs vs others' needs are distinguishable.

Medium

Some boundaries exist, but they may be blurry or situational.

Low

Identity, roles, or responsibilities are unclear, overlapping, or tangled.

In practice:
Low differentiation → boundary confusion
High differentiation → clarity, separation of concerns

Contextual Fit Interpretation
High

Your decision fits the actual circumstances well.
Reality and intention line up.

Medium

Some parts of the situation fit, but others don’t quite match the context.

Low

There is a strong mismatch between what you’re trying to do and the environment you’re in (timing, constraints, readiness, etc.).

In practice:
Low fit → misalignment with reality here and now
High fit → contextual alignment

Accountability Interpretation
High

You have a clear view of consequences and responsibilities.
You understand what’s happening and why.

Medium

Some parts are clear, but others remain opaque or uncertain.

Low

Key information, consequences, or responsibilities are unclear, hidden, or confusing.

In practice:
Low accountability → uncertainty + blind spots
High accountability → transparency + clarity

Reflexivity Interpretation
High

You can adjust safely, adapt, learn, update your approach, and move flexibly.

Medium

You can adjust somewhat, but the situation may limit easy change.

Low

You feel stuck, unable to update the situation or adjust course safely.

In practice:
Low reflexivity → rigidity or constrained adaptability
High reflexivity → freedom to revise and grow

⭐ Meta-Interpretation Layer

(This is the part users REALLY need.)

When scores are high (0.7–1.0):

The structure of the situation is relatively coherent

You have more stability or room to move

You can act without major relational disruption

When scores are medium (0.4–0.6):

The structure is mixed, with both supportive and conflicting patterns

Your decision likely has trade-offs

You may need to clarify boundaries, expectations, or context

When scores are low (0.0–0.3):

The situation has structural tension, instability, or conflict

Acting without adjustment might cause strain or fragmentation

It’s worth slowing down and examining the relational structure more deeply
