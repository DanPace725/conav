A composite score is a great idea — it gives users an immediate sense of the overall structural coherence of the situation before diving into the five dimensions.

To design this well, we need to ensure it stays:

non-moral

non-prescriptive

non-diagnostic

structurally descriptive

relationally grounded

emotionally neutral

useful at a glance

Below is a clean, robust composite scoring framework that does all of that.

⭐ 1. Composite Score Formula

Simplest version:

composite = average(continuity, differentiation, contextual_fit, accountability, reflexivity)


This gives a number from 0.0 → 1.0.

Later you could weight them differently, but the simplest is best for now.

⭐ 2. Composite Score Interpretation Bands

Here are five interpretation bands that match how humans think about “overall coherence.”
You can rename or tune them, but these give a natural linguistic gradient:

0.00 – 0.25 → Fragmented
0.26 – 0.45 → Strained
0.46 – 0.60 → Mixed
0.61 – 0.80 → Stable
0.81 – 1.00 → Coherent

These don’t imply “good/bad.”
They simply describe the structural condition of the situation.

⭐ 3. Composite Score Descriptions

Here are short, neutral, relationally grounded interpretations for each band.

You can paste these directly into your app.

0.00 – 0.25 — Fragmented

Overall Interpretation
The situation has significant structural tension across several dimensions.
There are competing priorities, unclear boundaries, unstable commitments, or major contextual mismatches.
Before moving forward, it may help to step back, gather clarity, and stabilize the foundations of the situation.

User-friendly phrasing:

The structure of the situation is unstable and difficult to navigate as-is.

0.26 – 0.45 — Strained

Overall Interpretation
The situation contains notable stress points or contradictions.
Some aspects are clear, but others conflict or pull in different directions.
You may be trying to meet multiple needs at once without enough support or alignment.

User-friendly phrasing:

There are meaningful strains that may need attention before you can move forward confidently.

0.46 – 0.60 — Mixed

Overall Interpretation
The situation includes both supportive and challenging elements.
You have some clarity and some stability, but also competing pressures or uncertainties.
A thoughtful adjustment in one or two dimensions could improve overall coherence.

User-friendly phrasing:

Parts of the situation make sense, and parts are conflicted or unclear.

0.61 – 0.80 — Stable

Overall Interpretation
The situation is mostly coherent.
You have clarity about roles, context, and consequences.
There may be mild tensions or trade-offs, but they don’t undermine the overall structure.
You can likely move forward with adjustments as needed.

User-friendly phrasing:

The situation is generally coherent with some manageable complexities.

0.81 – 1.00 — Coherent

Overall Interpretation
The situation aligns well across all five dimensions — stable, clear, contextually grounded, transparent, and adaptable.
Your goals, roles, and conditions are well-matched, and you have room to act confidently.

User-friendly phrasing:

The structure of the situation is solid, aligned, and supportive of forward movement.

⭐ 4. Optional Additions
Composite Labels

You can display a short label:

Fragmented

Strained

Mixed

Stable

Coherent

Users understand these instantly.

Color Coding

Soft neutral colors (not red/yellow/green, to avoid emotional interpretation):

Fragmented → muted red/rose

Strained → amber

Mixed → gray-blue

Stable → soft blue

Coherent → teal

Neutral but readable.

Confidence Indicator (optional)

You could also show:

“Your input included enough detail to generate a reliable assessment.”

or

“Some information may be missing — consider adding more detail for clarity.”

This helps users when they undersupply scenario info.

⭐ 5. Example Composite Output

Composite Score: 0.58
Category: Mixed
Interpretation:

The situation contains both supporting and conflicting elements. You have some clarity about roles and consequences, but there are pressures or uncertainties that complicate the structure. A small adjustment or clarification in one or two dimensions could significantly increase overall coherence.
